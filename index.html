		// Instructions. Complete the following assignments. Use the js/people.js dataset
		// You may modify the html of the page to make it simpler to inject html into it


		// 1. Use underscore to find the oldest person. 
		//		Use jQuery to inject their full name into the page, e.g. 'Oldest peron: x'


		// 2. Use underscore to find the youngest person
		//		Use jQuery to inject their full name into the page, e.g. 'Youngest peron: x'


		// 3. Use underscore to find the most common hair color
		//		Use jQuery to inject it into the page, e.g. 'Most common hair color: x'

	
		// 4. Use underscore to find the most common music preference
		//		Use jQuery to inject it into the page, e.g. 'Most popular music: x'


		// 5. Use underscore to find the youngest person who likes 'techno' music
		//		Log their name to the console.


		// 6. Use underscore to find out how many people like country.
		//		Log the amount to the console.


		// 7. Use underscore to create a new list of people. The list should contain
		//		the same people in the original list, except for now, everybody likes
		//		techno music. Log the result to the console.


		// 8. Use underscore to create a new list of people. The list should 
		//		be based on the original list, except for now, everybody is twice
		//		as old as they were before, and if they are older than 70, do not include 
		//		them in the resulting list. Everything else remains the same.


		// 9. Use underscore to iterate through the list. Use underscore templating
		//		to create a div for each person. In the div, add a paragraph for
		//		all of the attributes except firstName and lastName. For firstName
		//		and lastName, create a single paragraph for 'Name'. Define a helper
		//		function that creates the full name from the first and last names and
		//		use it in the template. Create a helper function to translate the sex
		//		attribute into text: 0 = 'Male', 1 = 'Female' and use it in the template
		//		Be sure to extend each of the objects with your helper function!
		//		Use jQuery to inject the resulting html into the page.
